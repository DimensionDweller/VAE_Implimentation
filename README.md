# Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for Generating Faces

This project presents a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on the CelebA dataset for 50 epochs. The model can generate novel images of faces, demonstrating impressive results. Two additional features are also provided: a function to display the distribution of the latent space variables and another to manipulate novel images by performing arithmetic in the latent space.

## Background

A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model that's excellent for learning a compressed representation of input data. It achieves this by encoding the data into a lower-dimensional latent space and then decoding it back. This project uses a VAE to generate novel face images.

## Project Description

The model is trained on the CelebA dataset, a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200,000 celebrity images, each with 40 attribute annotations. The training was performed for 50 epochs.

This project also includes two additional features:
- A function to display the distribution of the latent space variables. This helps to understand the distribution of the latent space learned by the VAE.
- A function to manipulate novel images by performing arithmetic in the latent space. This feature allows users to generate novel faces with specified attributes by manipulating the latent variables.

Of course, you'll need to fill in the sections with your own content, especially the "Results" and "Usage" sections. It's also a good idea to add some images or gifs to make the README more engaging.
